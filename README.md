# VaingloryScripts
Two scripts that generate hero stats comparison charts in Vainglory.

GetHeroInfo.py, written in Python, retrieves hero stats from the Vainglory website (www.vainglorygame.com), processes the data, then writes the formatted information to HeroStats.txt.

ShowHeroStatsComparisonCharts.m is a MATLAB script that reads HeroStats.txt and plots all the comparison graphs.
